## Description

Alice is a web3 2D game that follows the journey of a young girl as she navigates the relentless pressure to conform to society's standards. As players guide Alice through her struggles, they will witness her battling against societal expectations and her own inner conflicts.

Throughout the game, players will encounter a mysterious girl who speaks in random phrases generated by AI. As Alice collects coins to gain social acceptance, she must also dodge road bombs that will cause her to lose all of her progress.

At the end of the game, players can mint the ERC20 ALC tokens they have earned through a voucher system that is cryptographically signed. Through this journey, players will come to understand that Alice's greatest obstacle was herself.
